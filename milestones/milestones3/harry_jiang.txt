This paragraph is about the roommate app, specifically the feature about adding and viewing chores. The logic for chores is in the chores controller, the skeleton of which was generated using rspec scaffolding. The chore model has clean associations, each chore has a chore recurrance and appropriate models in the chore class. The code is a little confusing in that there's a chore_recurrance model, as well as a chores_reucrrance and chores_recurrances model. A user is tied to a chore in the database via chore_association models. Login is handled through the user class and sessions class. The code is overall clean and easy to understand and makes good use of blocks in appropriate cases.
