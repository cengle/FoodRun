Group: Roommate App
Site: electric-leaf.heroku.com

I examined electric-leaf's web roommate application for this assignment. Their application
	is designed to make it easier for roommates to be able to easily manage bills and chores
	online. Each user creates an account, and is then able to search for his roommates' accounts
	via email to begin sharing chores and bills. I decided to inspect the feature that allowed
	users to split bills arbitrarily. I originally assumed that functionality that dealt with 
	calculations on differnet bills would be located in the bills model, but after examining
	the code, the members of electric-leaf had placed the core calculation functionality in
	the controller. Each time the index function in the bills controller is called, the amount
	of money each roommate owes for each bill is calculated, along with how much money is owed
	to him by other roommates. The function clearly works properly, but in a later revision should
	probably be refactored to follow SOFA guidelines.
